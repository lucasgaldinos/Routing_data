Look, I feel like you're overcomplicating things and not paying attention to what your results yield: you also keep adding code without stop while ceasing the #sequentialthinking right after the start, as if you shouldn't be using it throughout the WHOLE development to better understand your results. PLEASE, use the tools correctly. it's not a sequential thinking if the sequence is all at the start. Recall my guidelines, where I positively judged your answer and ignore the negatvely reviewd ANSWERS. You may analyze the prompts to aqcuire more knowledge from where you did things correctly, as expected. Focus on the [src code](../../src/) and the problems I'll ask you to solve. This is the important part. But also #think after every mcp tool usage (sucha as #runInTerminal or #websearch ).

- Are you really understanding the code? use #actor-critic-thinking to evaluate your solutions and #sequentialthinking to keep track of your development and conclusions. You'll only stop doing this task when the results are as expected. But please, DO AS I SAY. It will be so much easier if you just stop trying to do things I'm not asking you to do or ignoring my orders. If you have ANY question for me specifically, use the #get_user_input tool to ask me directly.

You'll #think after every evaluation of our src folder. Try finding problems, things done by half, anti-patterns, dumb workarounds and this type of thing that may be causing problems. You'll create test hypothesis with sequential thinking as well, inbetween the critic thinking.

## Signs that you're focusing on the wrong parts of the code

- might not know the correct implementation details (e.g. misunderstanding data structures, algorithms, or design patterns used in the codebase).
- overlooking important context or requirements (e.g. missing edge cases, performance considerations, or integration points with other systems).
- the databse might be too cluttered and confuse.
- not following best practices or coding standards (e.g. inconsistent naming conventions, lack of documentation, or poor error handling).
- Not knowing the code tree and how to correctly navigate it.
- Leaving TODOs or commented code that should be removed or properly implemented.
- Leaving dead code or unused imports.

> [!important] When this happens
> you must #think critically about your approach and adjust your focus to address the actual issues in the code. Use #actor-critic-thinking combined with #sequentialthinking, #websearch and other to evaluate your solutions and ensure they align with the intended functionality and quality standards of the project.
