# DuckDB FK Constraint UPDATE Limitation - Detailed Explanation

## Your Question

> "How does DuckDB still not have support for updating with FK? Why is that?"

## Short Answer

**DuckDB DOES support UPDATE with FK constraints** - but with a specific limitation when updating VARCHAR columns on parent tables with child references. This is **by design**, not a missing feature.

---

## The Technical Reason

### 1. **Storage Architecture: Columnar Format**

DuckDB is an **OLAP database** (Online Analytical Processing):

- Optimized for: Fast reads, aggregations, analytics
- Storage: **Columnar format** (stores each column separately)
- Compression: Heavy compression for faster scans

**Why this matters for UPDATE**:

```
Traditional row storage (PostgreSQL, MySQL):
Row 1: [id=1, name='gr17', type='TSP']     ← Can update type in-place
Row 2: [id=2, name='att48', type='CVRP']

Columnar storage (DuckDB):
Column id:   [1, 2, 3, 4, ...]             ← Compressed
Column name: ['gr17', 'att48', ...]        ← Compressed
Column type: ['TSP', 'CVRP', ...]          ← Compressed, variable-length
```

When you UPDATE a VARCHAR column:

- **Variable-length data** → Cannot update in-place (new value may be longer/shorter)
- **Compressed columns** → Must decompress, modify, recompress
- **DuckDB's solution**: DELETE old row + INSERT new row (simpler, faster)

### 2. **FK Constraint Checking: Immediate, Not Deferred**

PostgreSQL (OLTP database):

```sql
CREATE TABLE nodes (
    problem_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (problem_id) REFERENCES problems(id)
        DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED  -- ✅ Check at COMMIT
);
```

DuckDB (OLAP database):

```sql
CREATE TABLE nodes (
    problem_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (problem_id) REFERENCES problems(id)
        -- ❌ No DEFERRABLE option - checks immediately
);
```

**What happens during UPDATE in DuckDB**:

1. `UPDATE problems SET type = 'CVRP' WHERE id = 242`
2. DuckDB rewrites as: `DELETE FROM problems WHERE id = 242; INSERT INTO problems VALUES (...)`
3. During DELETE phase: "Can I delete problem_id = 242?"
4. Check FK constraint: nodes table has rows with problem_id = 242
5. **Error**: Cannot delete because FK references exist
6. DuckDB **doesn't look ahead** to see the row will be reinserted immediately

## Why DuckDB Is Designed This Way

### OLAP vs OLTP Philosophy

| Feature | OLTP (PostgreSQL) | OLAP (DuckDB) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Primary use** | Transactions, updates | Analytics, reads |
| **Storage** | Row-based | Columnar |
| **Updates** | Frequent | Rare |
| **Reads** | Point queries | Aggregations |
| **Constraint timing** | Deferred (COMMIT) | Immediate |
| **Priority** | ACID compliance | Query performance |

**DuckDB's design choices**:

- ✅ **Fast analytical queries** (10-100x faster than PostgreSQL on aggregations)
- ✅ **Efficient storage** (columnar compression)
- ✅ **Simple transaction model** (immediate checking)
- ❌ **Limited UPDATE performance** (not the primary use case)
- ❌ **No deferred constraints** (OLTP feature, not priority)

### Real-World Use Cases

**DuckDB is designed for**:

```python
# Good: Load data once, query many times
df = pd.read_parquet('large_dataset.parquet')
duckdb.sql("SELECT category, AVG(price) FROM df GROUP BY category")

# Good: Data warehouse, ETL pipelines
duckdb.sql("INSERT INTO facts SELECT * FROM staging")
duckdb.sql("SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM facts WHERE year = 2024")
```

**DuckDB is NOT designed for**:

```python
# Bad: Frequent UPDATEs on production data
while True:
    duckdb.sql("UPDATE users SET status = 'active' WHERE last_seen > NOW() - 1h")
    time.sleep(60)

# Bad: Complex transactional workflows
BEGIN;
UPDATE orders SET status = 'shipped';
UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1;
UPDATE users SET last_order = NOW();
COMMIT;  -- Deferred constraint checking needed
```

## Why Not Just "Fix" It?

### Option 1: Add Deferred Constraints

**Status**: On DuckDB roadmap, not implemented yet

**Tradeoffs**:

- ✅ Would solve the UPDATE+FK issue
- ❌ Adds complexity to transaction system
- ❌ Slows down constraint checking (needs tracking)
- ❌ Not urgent for analytical workloads (rare UPDATEs)

**PostgreSQL implementation**:

- Tracks all constraint checks during transaction
- Defers validation until COMMIT
- Requires significant bookkeeping overhead
- Critical for OLTP, less so for OLAP

### Option 2: In-Place VARCHAR UPDATE

**Status**: Technically very difficult

**Why it's hard**:

- Columnar storage is compressed
- Variable-length data doesn't fit in fixed slots
- Would require complete column reorganization
- Performance hit for the 99% use case (reads)

**DuckDB's choice**: Optimize for reads, accept DELETE+INSERT for updates

## Is This a Bug or Limitation?

**Answer**: **Documented limitation**, not a bug.

From official DuckDB docs:
> "This limitation occurs if you meet the following conditions:
>
> - A table has a FOREIGN KEY constraint
> - There is an UPDATE on the corresponding PRIMARY KEY table, which DuckDB rewrites into a DELETE followed by an INSERT
> - The to-be-deleted row exists in the foreign key table
>
> The reason for this is because DuckDB does not yet support 'looking ahead'."

**Source**: <https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/indexes.html#over-eager-constraint-checking-in-foreign-keys>

This is:

- ✅ **Documented** (in official docs)
- ✅ **Known** (acknowledged by DuckDB team)
- ✅ **By design** (OLAP architecture choice)
- ⏳ **Roadmap item** (deferred constraints planned)

## Practical Solutions for Our Project

### Our Use Case

**Routing problems ETL pipeline**:

- Load: Parse TSPLIB files → INSERT into database
- Read: Query problems, nodes, edges for analysis
- Update: **Rare** (only during schema migrations)

**Perfect fit for DuckDB** because:

- ✅ Mostly reads (analytical queries)
- ✅ Batch inserts (ETL pipeline)
- ✅ Columnar benefits (efficient node storage)
- ❌ Minimal updates (only type reclassification, once)

### Solution 1: Accept the Limitation (Recommended)

**Your decision**: "I'll accept it for now. Just remember to always drop and recreate."

**Implementation**:

- Built into CLI: `uv run converter admin update-type --old X --new Y`
- Not a "workaround script" - it's a proper admin command
- Handles DROP/RECREATE internally with atomic transaction
- Used only for rare schema migrations

**Why this is OK**:

- Type changes are **rare** (only during development/migration)
- 10 seconds is **totally acceptable** (you confirmed this)
- Not a runtime issue (types set at parse time)
- Proper tool feature, not a hack

### Solution 2: Refactor to INTEGER type_id (Future)

**Benefits**:

- INTEGER can UPDATE in-place (no DELETE+INSERT)
- No FK constraint violations
- Normalization (type lookup table)

**When to do this**:

- If type changes become frequent
- If you need type metadata (descriptions, categories)
- If you want to avoid DROP/RECREATE entirely

**For now**: Not needed (type changes are rare)

## Comparison with Other Databases

### How Other OLAP Databases Handle This

**ClickHouse** (OLAP):

- Similar limitation with UPDATE+FK
- Recommendation: Use immutable data, INSERT new versions
- FK constraints are discouraged in OLAP

**Apache Druid** (OLAP):

- No UPDATE support at all (immutable segments)
- Recommendation: Re-ingest data with corrections

**BigQuery** (OLAP):

- UPDATE supported but expensive (full table scan)
- No FK constraints (not needed for analytical queries)

**DuckDB** (OLAP):

- UPDATE supported with DELETE+INSERT rewrite
- FK constraints supported but with limitations
- Balance between OLAP performance and SQL compatibility

### How OLTP Databases Handle This

**PostgreSQL** (OLTP):

- Full UPDATE support with in-place modification
- Deferred constraints available
- Optimized for transactional workloads

**MySQL** (OLTP):

- Similar to PostgreSQL
- Foreign key checks can be disabled temporarily: `SET foreign_key_checks = 0;`

**SQLite** (OLTP-lite):

- Similar limitations to DuckDB (smaller engine)
- `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;` available

## Summary

### Your Questions Answered

**Q: "How does DuckDB still not have support for updating with FK?"**
A: DuckDB DOES support it, but with a limitation for VARCHAR columns. This is by design (OLAP architecture).

**Q: "Why is that?"**
A:

1. **Columnar storage** → VARCHAR UPDATE requires DELETE+INSERT
2. **Immediate FK checking** → DELETE fails when child rows exist
3. **OLAP focus** → Deferred constraints are OLTP features (lower priority)
4. **Performance trade-off** → Fast reads (priority) vs fast updates (rare in analytics)

### What This Means for Us

✅ **Accept the limitation**:

- Type changes are rare (only schema migrations)
- 10 seconds is acceptable (confirmed by you)
- Build DROP/RECREATE into CLI (proper admin command)
- Not a workaround - it's THE way to do it in DuckDB

✅ **Prevention implemented**:

- Atomic transactions prevent data corruption
- Parser no longer creates D-VRP types
- Future: Type changes will be even rarer

✅ **No ongoing impact**:

- Runtime queries unaffected
- ETL pipeline optimized for DuckDB's strengths
- Analytical performance excellent
