# Archive - Historical Documentation

This folder contains historical documentation and development artifacts that provide context about the project's evolution but are no longer part of the active documentation set.

## üìÅ Contents

### Development Notes

- `agent-clarification-points.md` - Original project scope clarification and requirements gathering
- `agent-overnight.md` - Comprehensive implementation issue for GitHub Copilot coding agent

### Phase Documentation  

- `phase1.md` - Detailed Phase 1 implementation specifications
- `implementation-plan.md` - Original 3-phase development plan

### Topic-Specific Documentation

- `vrps.md` - Vehicle Routing Problem specific analysis and requirements

### Development Artifacts

- `modular-tasks/` - Empty folder for task organization (no longer used)
- `development-plan.mmd` - Legacy development timeline diagram

## üìö Relationship to Current Documentation

### Replaced by Current Guides

| Archived Document | Replaced By | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| `agent-clarification-points.md` | `development/PROJECT_STATUS.md` | Requirements now in project status |
| `implementation-plan.md` | `development/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` | Implementation story in dev guide |
| `phase1.md` | `development/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md` | Phase details in workflow guide |

### Still Relevant for Historical Context

- `agent-overnight.md` - Shows complete system requirements as understood by coding agent
- `vrps.md` - Domain-specific analysis that informed VRP support design

## üîç Why These Files Were Archived

**Development Evolution**: As the project matured, these documents served their purpose but became superseded by more comprehensive, user-focused documentation.

**Documentation Consolidation**: Information from these files has been integrated into the current organized documentation structure in `guides/`, `reference/`, and `development/`.

**Clarity & Maintenance**: Keeping the main documentation focused on current users while preserving historical context for future reference.

## üìñ Using Archived Documentation

### For Project History

- Review `agent-clarification-points.md` to understand original requirements
- Check `implementation-plan.md` for original architectural thinking
- See `agent-overnight.md` for complete system specification

### For Development Context

- `phase1.md` shows detailed implementation approach for core infrastructure
- Development artifacts show evolution of project organization

### For Domain Understanding

- `vrps.md` provides deep analysis of Vehicle Routing Problem considerations
